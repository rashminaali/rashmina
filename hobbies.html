<h3>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.</h3> 
<h3>I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, </h3>
<h3>I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. </h3>
<h3>I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. </h3>
<h3>I like to sleep early, I like to get up late. I like the beautiful Namsan Tower in Korea. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; </h3>
<h3>I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</h3>
